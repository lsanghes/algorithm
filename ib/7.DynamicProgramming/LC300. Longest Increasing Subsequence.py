'''
Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given sequence / array.

In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequenceâ€™s elements
are in strictly increasing order, and in which the subsequence is as long as
possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or unique. In this
case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Example :

Input : [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
Output : 6
The sequence : [0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15]
            or [0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15]
            or [0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15]
