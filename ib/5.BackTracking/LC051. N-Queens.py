'''
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard
such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens'
placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space
respectively.

For example,
There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

[
   [".Q..",  // Solution 1
    "...Q",
    "Q...",
    "..Q."],

   ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
    "Q...",
    "...Q",
    ".Q.."]
